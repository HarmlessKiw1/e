    <h2>My Favorite Cards in my Favorite Decks</h2>
    <img src="/images/prossh.jpg" height="250" alt="Prossh"> <img src="/images/goblin.jpg" height="250" alt="goblin bombardment"> <img src="/images/devilish.jpg" height="250" alt="Devilish Valet">
    <ul>
        <li>Prossh, Skyraider of Kher (Commander)</li>
        <p>Prossh is my favorite card in the deck because its ability to make a number of kobolds equal to the amount of mana spent to
        cast it and it being a sacrifice outlet makes it a great commander and good for a couple of good combos, the deck that
        its in makes it so that I can winn without even attacking which makes it a nice passive deck the likes staying in the
        background until it goes in for one big amount of damage finishing everyone off.</p>
        <br>
        <li>Goblin Bombardment</li>
        <p>Goblin Bombardment is an even better sacrifice outlet than Prossh because it deal straight damge to things making my passive win even easier</p>
        <br>
        <li>Devilish Valet</li>
        <p>Devilish Valet is an incredible card to take out one person before it dies, it combos really well with Prossh because if Devilish Valet
        is on the battlefield when Prossh enters the battlefield its power gets doubled 7 times because of its ability, because
        it doubles 7 times its power goes from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 to 16 to 32 to 64 to 128 power with trample meaning for someone
        to block it and live even at full health they would need to block 89 damage to live.</p>
        <br>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Ghalta and Mavren (Commander)
        </li>
        <p>Ghalta and Mavren is one of my favorite cards in the deck because of the things in the deck that icrease various creatures power its
        ability becomes even better, things like Zopandrel Hunger Dominus doubling the power and toughness of each creature I
        control means that each turn the dinosaur I create becomes even bigger, but I also have a lot of token creature creation
        in the deck meaning that if I attack with a lot of creatures I can get a lot of vampires, I also have some token
        doubling like with Mondrak Glory Dominus.</p>
        <br>
        <li>
            Nissa, Ascended Animist
        </li>
        <p>Nissa Ascended Animist is a really cool card and can do a lot of cool things that have great synergy with the rest of my deck, its +1 ability
        makes as soon as it comes out a minimum of an 8/8 creature which paired with my commander will make an 8/8 dinosaur with
        trample meaning I get a lot of creatures that are really big, its -7 ability is also really good since it is a green and
        white deck a little more than half of the lands in the deck are forests making it give even more power and toughness to
        my creatures which is a great way to end the game.</p>
        <br>
        <li>
            Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite
        </li>
        <p>Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite is a great card because it will make my creatures bigger while making my opponents creatures smaller which is great
        because a lot of creatures in my deck have trample and the less they have to get through the mroe damage they will deal.</p>
        <br>
    </ul>
    <img src="/images/atraxa.jpg" height="250" alt="Atraxa, Praetors' Voice"> <img src="/images/teferi.jpg" height="250" alt="Teferi, Master of Time"> <img src="/images/vorinclex.jpg" height="250" alt="Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider">
    <ul>
        <li>Atraxa, Praetors' Voice (Commander)</li>
        <p>Atraxa, Praetors' Voice is a great card because of its abilities of flying, deathtouch, vigilance, and lifelink, flying is only blockable by flying and reach which makes it easier to deal damage, deathtouch makes it so that when it deals damage to a creature that creature gets destroyed, vigilance makes it so that it doesn't tap when it attacks, and lifelink means that if you do damage to a player or creature you gain life equal to the power of Atraxa, and then it's last ability which is at the begining of your end step proliferate, proliferate is great because if your creatures have at least one +1/+1 counter you can proliferate that by one making it 1 more of that counter than before, it is also great with poison counters becaue 10 poison counters is lethal so proliferating at least once per turn makes it so that in 10 turns at most someone is out of the game.</p>
        <br>
        <li>Teferi, Master of Time</li>
        <p>Teferi, Master of Time is amazing in a proliferate deck because since you can add at least 1 loyalty counter per turn
        getting to at least 10 is pretty easy, but when adding that to proliferate makes it even better because proliferating on
        average 2+ times per turn means that you'll be taking so many extra turns.</p>
        <br>
        <li>Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider</li>
        <p>Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider is amazing in this deck because all the planeswalkers in the deck getting at least 2 loyalty
        counters per turn or creatures you control getting at least 2 +1/+1 counters per turn or creatures you don't control
        getting at least 2 -1/-1 counters per turn if they get a -1/-1 counter on it or even at least 2 poison counters on
        players per turn once they get a poison counter makes it where it takes half the time to get rid of players.</p>
    </ul>
